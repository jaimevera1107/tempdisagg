# temporal-dissagregation

**Temporal Disaggregation Models in Python**

`temporal-dissagregation` is a Python library for temporal disaggregation of time series data. It supports all classical methods (Chow-Lin, Litterman, Denton, Fernández, Uniform) and provides a modular, extensible and production-ready architecture inspired by the R package `temp-dissag`. The implementation includes regression-based models, differencing approaches, ensemble predictions, post-estimation adjustments, and full integration with the scientific Python stack.

Many official statistics and business indicators are reported at low frequencies (e.g., annually or quarterly), but decision-making often demands high-frequency data. Temporal disaggregation bridges this gap by estimating high-frequency series that remain consistent with aggregated values.  
**temporal-dissagregation** provides a flexible and modular interface for performing temporal disaggregation using multiple statistical, econometric, and machine learning techniques — all in Python.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
pip install tempdisagg
```

### 💡 Quick Example

```python
from tempdisagg import TempDisaggModel

# Create your DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Index": [2020]*12 + [2021]*12,
    "Grain": list(range(1, 13))*2,
    "y": [1200] + [np.nan]*11 + [1500] + [np.nan]*11,
    "X": np.linspace(100, 200, 24)
})

# Initialize and fit model
model = TempDisaggModel(method="chow-lin-opt", conversion="sum")
model.fit(df)

# Predict high-frequency series
y_hat = model.predict()

# Summary and plots
model.summary()
model.plot(df)
```

### 🤖 How does the Ensemble Prediction work?

The ensemble module allows combining multiple disaggregation methods into a single high-frequency estimate. It works by:

1. **Fitting multiple models** individually on the same input dataset using methods like `chow-lin`, `denton`, `fernandez`, etc.
2. **Computing the aggregated prediction error** (e.g., RMSE or MAE) of each model with respect to the low-frequency constraint.
3. **Optimizing weights** across models using non-negative least squares to minimize the error of the aggregated prediction (subject to weights summing to 1).
4. **Generating a final ensemble prediction**:  
   $$\hat{y}_{ensemble} = \sum_{i} w_i \cdot \hat{y}_i$$
   where $\hat{y}_i$ is the prediction of the \(i\)-th model and \( w_i \) is its optimal weight.

Additional features:
- Bootstrap-based confidence intervals for the ensemble.
- Aggregated statistics such as average coefficients and combined R².
- Visual comparison of all component models via `.plot(df, show_individuals=True)`.

### 🤝 Ensemble Modeling
```python
model = temporal-dissagregationModel(conversion="average")
model.ensemble(df)

model.summary()
model.plot(df, use_adjusted=True)
```

### 🚫 How does the Negative Value Adjustment work?

Temporal disaggregation methods may produce negative high-frequency values when:
- The low-frequency total is small.
- The method uses strong differencing or extrapolation.
- Indicator series are noisy or weakly correlated.

To address this, `tempdisagg` applies a post-estimation adjustment that:

1. **Detects negative predictions** in `y_hat`.
2. **Groups values** by low-frequency periods using the conversion matrix \( C \).
3. **Redistributes residuals** within each group to ensure all values are non-negative and consistent:
   - Preserves the original sum (`C @ y_hat_adjusted = y_l`).
   - Applies proportional or uniform redistribution to correct negatives.
   - Ensures $\hat{y}_{adjusted} \geq 0 $ without breaking constraints.

### ✅ Negatives Adjustment
```python
model = temporal-dissagregationModel(conversion="average")
model.predict(df)
model.adjust_output(df)
```

## 🗂️ Input Time Series Format

To use `TempDisModel`, your time series data must be organized in a **long-format DataFrame** with one row per high-frequency observation. The model requires the following columns:

| Column          | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `Index`         | Identifier for the low-frequency group (e.g., year, quarter). This groups the target values. |
| `Grain`         | Identifier for the high-frequency breakdown within each `Index` (e.g., month, quarter number). |
| `y`             | The **low-frequency target variable** (repeated across the group). This is the variable to disaggregate. |
| `X`             | The **high-frequency indicator** variable (available at the granular level). Used to guide the disaggregation. |

| Index | Grain | y       | X         |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------|
| 2000  | 1     | 1000.00 | 80.21     |
| 2000  | 2     | 1000.00 | 91.13     |
| 2000  | 3     | 1000.00 | 85.44     |
| 2000  | 4     | 1000.00 | 92.32     |
| 2001  | 1     | 1200.00 | 88.71     |
| 2001  | 2     | 1200.00 | 93.55     |
| ...   | ...   | ...     | ...       |
